An offset dumper for [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/) written entirely in C#.




## Getting Started
___You can either build the project with the instructions below or download the prebuilt executable in [releases].(https://github.com/KyeOnDiscord/CSGO_Offset_Dumper/releases)___

### Prerequisites
* [![.NET 6 SDK](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-6_SDK-5a25e3)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

### Building the Project
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KyeOnDiscord/CSGO_Offset_Dumper.git
   ```
2. Goto the folder directory
   ```sh
   cd CSGO_Offset_Dumper
   ```
4. Build the project
   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```
   
   
## Usage

1. Put your config.json file into the same directory as `CSGO_Offset_Dumper.exe`. If you don't have a config.json file, you can get one from [hazedumper](https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper/blob/master/config.json).
2.  Launch csgo in steam using [`-insecure`](https://guidedhacking.com/threads/how-to-bypass-vac-valve-anti-cheat-info.8125/) so [VAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Anti-Cheat) is not loaded.
3.  Open `CSGO_Offset_Dumper.exe` and your files will be dumped.

## Features

✔ Compatible with [hazedumper](https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper/blob/master/config.json) & [GH Offset Dumper](https://guidedhacking.com/resources/guided-hacking-offset-dumper-gh-offset-dumper.51/) config files
